# Simple HTML and CSS Project

This project is a basic web page created using HTML and enhanced with CSS. It serves as a practical application of the fundamental concepts I've learned in HTML and CSS, including working with classes, IDs, images, and links. The primary focus of this project is to explore and implement the `display: flex` property in CSS.

## Project Overview

The webpage consists of different sections, including headers, a sidebar, content containers, and a footer. The design and layout are intentionally kept simple to emphasize the application of the `flexbox` model in CSS.

## Features and Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The project leverages HTML for structuring the content, utilizing elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, and images.

- **CSS:** The styling is done using CSS, with a particular emphasis on the `display: flex` property for flexible and responsive layout design.

- **Images:** Various images are incorporated to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage.

## Final Version

This version represents the completion of the project's design. While I may continue to add text or make minor improvements, the primary goal has been achievedâ€”applying and practicing HTML and CSS concepts, specifically focusing on the powerful capabilities of `flexbox` for layout management.
