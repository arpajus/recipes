This is a simple project in HTML that I have been improved with CSS.

This is the final version. I will add some text, but the design is already done by the moment. I just applied the simply knowledge that I get at this moment of HTML and CSS, working with classes, id, images, links but the main goal of this webpage is to work with the display: flex of css.
